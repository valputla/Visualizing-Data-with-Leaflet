## General Information
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) provides data about various natural disasters and supplies information to the public about climate change, geologicial changes, and the health of our ecosystems, among others. This project focuses on earthquakes and provides the USGS a meaningful way of displaying earthquake data from the past 7 days. This data will assist with public education and could possibly assist in securing an increase in funding to address the hazards that impact the Earth.
